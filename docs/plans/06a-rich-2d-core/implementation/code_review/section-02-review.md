# Code Review: Section 02 - Viewport-Aware SharedScene

NO ISSUES FOUND. Implementation comprehensive and correct. All verification checklist items pass.

Key strengths: pure function extraction for testability, correct mobile fallback handling, consistent viewport gating pattern across Hall/FloorGrid/ArchitecturalFloorPlan, placement handler integration preserved.
