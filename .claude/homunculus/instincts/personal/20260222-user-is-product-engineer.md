# User Is Product Engineer, Claude Does the Coding

## Action
User is an experienced SWE but less web-specific. Claude does all coding autonomously. User trusts Claude to work without unnecessary prompts. Skip confirmation for obvious choices, streamline simple sections. But DO validate at meaningful architectural checkpoints.
