# User Loves Adversarial Review

## Action
At meaningful architectural checkpoints (not every section), run devils-advocate + blue-team skills. The user wants thorough design before coding — 3 rounds of review per design. But don't over-apply: streamline simple sections, only use at genuine decision points.
